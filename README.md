**Overview**

This project demonstrates the analysis and visualization of pizza sales data using SQL for database management and Excel for creating an interactive dashboard. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into pizza sales trends, inventory management, customer preferences, and financial performance.

**Project Components**

**SQL Database:** The project uses SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from a database. Data such as order details, customer information, product categories, and sales metrics are stored in SQL tables.

**Excel Dashboard:** Excel is used to visualize and present the data extracted from the SQL database. Pivot tables, charts, and slicers are used to create a user-friendly dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of pizza sales.

**Data Sources**
The dataset contains the following tables:

**Orders:** Includes data about customer orders, such as order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.

**Customers:** Contains customer details such as customer ID, name, contact information, and address.

**Products:** Includes product details such as product ID, product name, category, and price.

**Sales:** Contains detailed information about individual pizza sales, including quantity, product sold, and total sales per transaction.

**Features of the SQL & Excel Dashboard**

**SQL:**
Data Extraction: SQL queries extract specific data from the database, such as total sales, orders by date, sales by product category, and customer demographics.

**Data Transformation:** SQL joins, aggregations, and filtering are used to organize the data into a format that can be analyzed.

**Reports:** Custom queries generate sales reports, customer insights, and product performance statistics.

**Excel:**
**Sales Trends:** Line and bar charts are used to visualize sales trends over time, showing peak sales days, monthly sales growth, and seasonal fluctuations.

**Product Performance:** Pie charts and bar graphs show which types of pizzas are most popular and which are generating the most revenue.

**Customer Insights:** Pivot tables summarize customer purchase behaviors and preferences.

**Financial Insights:** Calculations for profit margins, total sales, and overall revenue are displayed in easy-to-read summary tables.

**Interactive Filters:** Excel slicers allow users to filter the data based on specific categories like date ranges, pizza types, or customer segments.
